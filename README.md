## Description :
GameSpace is a video game salon that wants to manage its customers in a progressive way each day. GameSpace asked you to create a Java console program that makes it easier to work and organize the schedules.

So, to make this project a success, you must focus mainly on these major points:


- [x] 1. The number of posts in the salon is 9 posts, (4 Xbox, 3 PlayStation5, 2 Nintendo switch) for the screens (3 Dell screens, 1 HP, 3 Asus screens, 2 Samsung)
- [x] 2. The games are classified by type, ex: (football: FIFA, PES ...), (War: Counter-Strike, Assassin's Creed)

- [x] 3. The opening hours are (09:00 - 12:00 and 14:00 - 20:00) and it uses the principle (first come first served), so once the posts will be occupied, the others can stay in the second waiting line.

- [x] 4. The waiting line has a maximum capacity of 8 places, so the max of players in the salon is 17.

- [x] 5. The players can choose between the available times (30 min / 1 hour / 2 hours / 5 hours / luxury player (all day).

- [x] 6. The rates are (5DH - 10DH - 18DH - 40 DH - 65 DH)

## Workflow :

- [x] 1• A player must choose the game and how long he wants to play.
- [x] 2• Admin of GameSpace enters the player's information (first name, last name, N ° of free post, start time, time period, chosen game), a player code must be automatically generated.
- [x] 3• The player pays the necessary amount.
- [x] 4• The chosen post is automatically started, once the time is up, a sign must be sent to turn off the post.
- [x] 5• After each payment of a player, the amount will be accumulated, to have the total amount of the day.
- [x] 6• The admin can also see the total income of the month.
- [x] 7• At the beginning, try to create the program of a procedural, later you can migrate your project to an object-oriented version.

## Bonus :
- [x] 1• Try to apply a percentage reduction of 5% for people who will play FIFA and for 2 hours or more, and a percentage of 2% for the first arrived at the game room, and 10% for those who will choose to play more than 5 hours using the PS5 post and Samsung screen.
